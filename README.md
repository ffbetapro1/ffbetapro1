## What is FF Beta Testing?
FF Beta Testing refers to the early access version of the Free Fire game, where selected users can try out new updates, features, game modes, and items before they are officially released. This version is known as the Free Fire Advance Server, and it allows players to provide valuable feedback to the developers to help improve the game.

Garena launches the Advance Server APK periodically, usually before a major update, and it includes upcoming content like new characters, pets, weapons, and game mechanics. By testing this content, players help identify bugs and offer suggestions to refine the game experience.
